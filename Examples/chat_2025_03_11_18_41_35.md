Yes, there is a mathematical equation to calculate the total number of features generated by the `get_hdmr_features` function, given the `labels` and `poly_degrees`. The total number of features depends on the number of input variables (`dims`), the polynomial degrees (`poly_degrees`), and the interaction orders.

Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

---

### Key Variables
1. **`dims`**: The number of input variables (length of `labels`).
2. **`order`**: The number of interaction orders (length of `poly_degrees`).
3. **`poly_degrees`**: A list of integers, where `poly_degrees[k]` is the maximum polynomial degree for the `(k+1)`-th interaction order.

---

### Formula for Total Number of Features
The total number of features can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Total Features} = \sum_{k=1}^{\text{order}} \binom{\text{dims}}{k} \times (\text{poly\_degrees}[k-1])^k
\]

Where:
- \(\binom{\text{dims}}{k}\) is the number of ways to choose \(k\) variables from `dims` variables (combinations).
- \((\text{poly\_degrees}[k-1])^k\) is the number of ways to assign polynomial degrees to the \(k\) variables, where each variable can have a degree from 1 to \(\text{poly\_degrees}[k-1]\).

---

### Explanation of the Formula
1. **Combinations of Variables**:
   - For the \(k\)-th interaction order, we choose \(k\) variables from `dims` variables. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{\text{dims}}{k}\).

2. **Polynomial Degrees**:
   - For each combination of \(k\) variables, we assign polynomial degrees to each variable. The degree for each variable can range from 1 to \(\text{poly\_degrees}[k-1]\).
   - The total number of degree assignments is \((\text{poly\_degrees}[k-1])^k\).

3. **Sum Over All Interaction Orders**:
   - We sum the contributions from all interaction orders \(k = 1\) to \(k = \text{order}\).

---

### Example Calculation
Suppose:
- `labels = ['x1', 'x2', 'x3']` (so `dims = 3`).
- `poly_degrees = [2, 3]` (so `order = 2`).

#### Step 1: First-Order Interactions (\(k = 1\))
- Number of combinations: \(\binom{3}{1} = 3\).
- Polynomial degrees: \(2^1 = 2\).
- Total features for \(k = 1\): \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

#### Step 2: Second-Order Interactions (\(k = 2\))
- Number of combinations: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\).
- Polynomial degrees: \(3^2 = 9\).
- Total features for \(k = 2\): \(3 \times 9 = 27\).

#### Step 3: Total Features
- Sum over all interaction orders: \(6 + 27 = 33\).

So, the total number of features generated is **33**.

### General Python Implementation
You can implement the formula in Python as follows:

```python
from math import comb

def calculate_total_features(dims, poly_degrees):
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, len(poly_degrees) + 1):
        combinations = comb(dims, k)
        degrees = poly_degrees[k - 1] ** k
        total += combinations * degrees
    return total
```

#### Example Usage:
```python
labels = ['x1', 'x2', 'x3']
poly_degrees = [2, 3]
dims = len(labels)
total_features = calculate_total_features(dims, poly_degrees)
print(total_features)  # Output: 33
```

---

### Summary
The total number of features is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Total Features} = \sum_{k=1}^{\text{order}} \binom{\text{dims}}{k} \times (\text{poly\_degrees}[k-1])^k
\]

This formula accounts for all combinations of variables and their polynomial degrees across all interaction orders. You can use the provided Python function to compute the total number of features for any given `labels` and `poly_degrees`.
