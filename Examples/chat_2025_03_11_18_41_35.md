# **Sobol Indices and Shapley Effects: A Comparative Analysis of Global Sensitivity Measures**  

## **Abstract**  
In uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis, Sobol indices and Shapley effects are two prominent global sensitivity measures. While Sobol indices are widely used in variance-based sensitivity analysis, Shapley effects have recently gained traction due to their axiomatic foundation from cooperative game theory. This paper explores the relationship between these two measures, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses, and discussing their practical applications.

## **1. Introduction**  
Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) plays a crucial role in model exploration and uncertainty quantification, particularly in engineering, finance, and environmental sciences. Among the different methods, **Sobol indices** are the gold standard for variance-based decomposition, whereas **Shapley effects** offer a theoretically robust alternative grounded in game theory. Understanding the link between these two measures helps researchers select the most appropriate sensitivity metric for their application.

This paper discusses:  
- The theoretical foundation of Sobol indices and Shapley effects.  
- Their mathematical formulation and interpretability.  
- Computational efficiency and robustness in different scenarios.  
- Practical use cases and trade-offs between the two methods.

## **2. Sobol Indices: Variance-Based Sensitivity Analysis**  

### **2.1 Definition and Calculation**  
Sobol indices measure the contribution of input variables to the total output variance. Given a model **\( Y = f(X_1, X_2, ..., X_d) \)**, the decomposition of variance is given by:  
$
V(Y) = \sum_{i} V_i + \sum_{i < j} V_{ij} + ... + V_{1,2,...,d}
$
where:  
- $( V_i = \text{Var}(\mathbb{E}[Y | X_i]) )$ is the **first-order Sobol index**.  
- $( V_{ij} = \text{Var}(\mathbb{E}[Y | X_i, X_j]) - V_i - V_j )$ is the **interaction term**.  
- The **total Sobol index** $( S_i^{\text{total}} )$ accounts for both individual and interaction effects.

### **2.2 Strengths and Limitations**  
**Advantages**:  
- Provides a detailed decomposition of variance.  
- Clearly identifies interactions among variables.  
- Well-established in the field with many efficient estimators (e.g., Saltelli's method).  

**Limitations**:  
- Requires independent input variables; struggles with correlated inputs.  
- Computationally expensive, especially in high-dimensional problems.

## **3. Shapley Effects: Axiomatic Approach to Sensitivity**  

### **3.1 Definition and Calculation**  
Shapley effects originate from cooperative game theory, allocating the contribution of each variable to the output variance in a fair manner. The Shapley value for an input **\( X_i \)** is defined as:  
$
\phi_i = \sum_{S \subseteq \{1,...,d\} \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|! (d - |S| - 1)!}{d!} \left[ V(S \cup \{i\}) - V(S) \right]
$
where $ V(S) $ represents the variance of the output using only inputs in subset $S $.

### **3.2 Strengths and Limitations**  
**Advantages**:  
- Works with dependent and correlated inputs.  
- Guarantees a fair attribution of variance through axioms of efficiency, symmetry, and linearity.  
- Ensures robustness against interactions by fairly distributing them.  

**Limitations**:  
- Computationally more expensive than Sobol indices due to the factorial complexity.  
- Requires specialized Monte Carlo or surrogate modeling techniques for estimation.

## **4. Comparison and Relationship Between Sobol Indices and Shapley Effects**  

| Feature | Sobol Indices | Shapley Effects |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Interpretability** | Decomposes variance into distinct components | Allocates variance fairly using game theory |
| **Handling of Interactions** | Identifies specific interaction effects | Distributes interactions across variables |
| **Computational Cost** | Moderate (Saltelli estimator) | High (combinatorial complexity) |
| **Applicability to Correlated Inputs** | Struggles with correlated variables | Naturally handles correlated inputs |
| **Axiomatic Foundation** | Variance decomposition | Fair allocation based on cooperative game theory |

### **4.1 Relationship Between the Two Measures**  
- **When inputs are independent**, Shapley effects yield values close to the total Sobol indices.  
- **For correlated inputs**, Shapley effects outperform Sobol indices by distributing effects fairly.  
- Shapley values can be interpreted as a weighted sum of all Sobol indices, accounting for interactions implicitly.

## **5. Practical Considerations for Choosing Between the Two**  

### **5.1 When to Use Sobol Indices?**  
- When input variables are independent.  
- When computational efficiency is a concern.  
- When interaction effects need explicit quantification.

### **5.2 When to Use Shapley Effects?**  
- When dealing with correlated inputs.  
- When fairness in attribution is important.  
- When variance decomposition alone is insufficient.  

### **5.3 Hybrid Approaches**  
Recent studies suggest combining Sobol and Shapley approaches. For instance, one can estimate Sobol indices for independent components and use Shapley effects for correlated subsets.

## **6. Conclusion**  
Both Sobol indices and Shapley effects offer powerful tools for global sensitivity analysis. While Sobol indices remain the standard for variance-based sensitivity analysis, Shapley effects provide a robust alternative, particularly for correlated inputs. The choice between them depends on the nature of the model, computational constraints, and the need for fair attribution. Future research may focus on hybrid techniques that balance accuracy and computational efficiency.
