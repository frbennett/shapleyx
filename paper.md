# Summary

<!--Statement of need-->

ShapleyX contains Python implementations of commonly used global sensitivity
analysis methods, including Sobol [@Sobol2001,@Saltelli2002a,@Saltelli2010a],
Morris [@Morris1991,@Campolongo2007], FAST [@Cukier1973,@Saltelli1999]. 

<!--Target Audience-->

ShapleX exposes a range of global sensitivity analysis techniques to the
scientist, researcher and modeller, making it very easy to easily implement
the range of techniques into typical modelling workflows. [@saltelli_sensitivity_2023].
